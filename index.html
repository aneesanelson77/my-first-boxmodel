<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> My name is Aneesa Nelson and in 18 years old going into 12th grade</p>

<div> I was born July 4, 2001 in Philadelphia, PA. I grew up in Northeast Philadelphia and me and my family members had always lived pretty close to each other. I went Wissahickon Charter School and with my sister and cousin already being there made it a easier year. In my 3rd grade year of Wissahickon I had I moved to Delaware switching schools to Kathleen H. Wilbur Elementary School in the middle of 3rd School. At firt it was different and felt werid in a whole new enviroment but, I had made some friends. </div>
